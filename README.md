### What's Up? I'm Matheus Cardoso. 🧔🏻

I'm Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻 for 11 years now with a wide range experience, but most of the time I work with web applications using Python and Javascript, but also like to buid mobile apps using JS as well. I'm on the remote work life a bit over 4 years. It's not easy and it's not perfect, but at least I can manage myself to balance work and time with my son. Here's a few things about me: 

- 👨‍👦 Before being a Sofwate Engineer, **I'm father** of a beautiful and much beloved son, my Benjamin. 
- 🇧🇷 I'm brazillian, but I can easily read and write in English. My listening and speaching are good. I can't say I'm fluent, but I can say that, for now, is enough for 2 different companies (🇩🇪 🇺🇸) from abroad and for more than 4 years. But I'm always trying to learn something new to improve my English. 
- 🔭 I’m currently **working** on web applications with Python and Javascript.
- 🌱 I’m **learning** (or at least trying) Swift and Swift UI. I'm more in favor of PWAs, but I'm trying to learning something new that has functional programming concepts and my son has an iPad, so I'd like to create some apps to help him. 
- 📚 I do like books, but I don't like programming books. I think after many years in college and post graduation course reading a lot of technincal books and scientific articles, I think my brain just likes any book, except from my area 🤷🏻‍♂️. Right now, I'm reading Yuval Harari, Sapiens. **UPDATE: In 2021 I bought my first programming books.** 
- ⏱ Unfortunately I still can't manage my time to do much after work, but if you are a beginner and want some help of mine, I'm fully available to guide or annswer any doubt in my reach. 
- 🎓 I'm MSc in Computer Science and I'm very proud of my Computation Engineering gradution, they both made half of the professional that I am. I like to be a Software Engineer, but I miss the old days of scientific research.
- 🍻 I do like a good beer with friends or a coffee mug with good company. I'm writing this in the end of 2020, the pandemic year, and I'm looking forward to be able to do those things again.
