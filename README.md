### What's Up? I'm Matheus Cardoso. 🧔🏻

I'm Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻 for 13 years now with a wide range of experience, but most of the time I work with web applications using Python and Javascript, but also like to build mobile apps using JS as well. I'm on the remote work life in 2016. It's not easy and it's not perfect, but at least I can manage myself to balance work and time with my son. Here are a few things about me: 

- 👨‍👦 Before being a Software Engineer, **I'm a father** of a beautiful and much-beloved son, Benjamin. 
- 🇧🇷 I'm Brazilian, but I can easily read and write in English. My listening and speaking are good. I can say that, for now, is enough for 4 different companies (🇩🇪 🇺🇸) from abroad and for more than 5 years. But I'm always trying to learn something new to improve my English. 
- 🔭 I’m currently **working** on web applications with Python and Javascript as a FullStack Software Engineer.
- 📚 In 2021 I bought my first programming/technical books [[1](https://djangoforprofessionals.com/)][[2](https://djangoforprofessionals.com/)]. Back in the day, I used to think that after many years in college and post-graduation courses reading a lot of technical books and scientific articles, I think my brain just would like any book, except my area 🤷🏻‍♂️. But now, I'm going all in and focus technical books to improve myself as a software engineer. Fast forward to 2023, I already read more than 3 technical books, like Clean Code, Clean Coder, and Clean Architecture!
- ⏱ Unfortunately I still can't manage my time to do much after work, but if you are a beginner and want some help from me, I'm fully available to guide or answer any doubts/questions on my reach. 
- 🎓 I'm MSc in Computer Science and I'm very proud of my Computation Engineering graduation, they both made me half of the professional that I am. I like to be a Software Engineer, but I miss the [old days of scientific research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-7tN6kAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 🍻 I do like a good beer with friends or a coffee mug with good company. I'm updating this in the beginning of 2023, after long COVID-19 years, and I'm trying as much as I can catching up the time I lost. 
- 📜 Oh, if you want/need to know more about me, reach me out. Or take a look at my "[resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheuscardoso/)" to get to know more about my professional side.
