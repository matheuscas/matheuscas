### What's Up? I'm Matheus Cardoso. 🧔🏻

I'm Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻 for 12 years now with a wide range experience, but most of the time I work with web applications using Python and Javascript, but also like to buid mobile apps using JS as well. I'm on the remote work life a bit over 5 years. It's not easy and it's not perfect, but at least I can manage myself to balance work and time with my son. Here's a few things about me: 

- 👨‍👦 Before being a Sofwate Engineer, **I'm father** of a beautiful and much beloved son, my Benjamin. 
- 🇧🇷 I'm brazillian, but I can easily read and write in English. My listening and speaching are good. I can't say I'm fluent, but I can say that, for now, is enough for 4 different companies (🇩🇪 🇺🇸) from abroad and for more than 5 years. But I'm always trying to learn something new to improve my English. 
- 🔭 I’m currently **working** on web applications with Python and Javascript as a FullStack Software Engineer.
- 📚 In 2021 I bought my first programming/technical books [[1](https://djangoforprofessionals.com/)][[2](https://djangoforprofessionals.com/)]. Back in the days, I used to think that after many years in college and post graduation course reading a lot of technincal books and scientific articles, I think my brain just would like any book, except from my area 🤷🏻‍♂️. But now, I'm going all in and focus technical books to improve myself as software enginner. 
- ⏱ Unfortunately I still can't manage my time to do much after work, but if you are a beginner and want some help from me, I'm fully available to guide or answer any doubt/question in my reach. 
- 🎓 I'm MSc in Computer Science and I'm very proud of my Computation Engineering gradution, they both made half of the professional that I am. I like to be a Software Engineer, but I miss the [old days of scientific research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-7tN6kAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 🍻 I do like a good beer with friends or a coffee mug with good company. I'm updating this in the beginning of 2022, third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I'm looking forward to be able to do those things again - now, more often. 
- 📜 Oh, if you want/need to know more about me, reach me out. Or take a look at my "[resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheuscardoso/)" to get to know more about my professional side.
